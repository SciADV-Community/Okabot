I see... so that's the choice of *Steins Gate*. El Psy Kongroo.
I have a hunch that the PhoneWave (name subject to change) may be the key to opening *Steins Gate*.
*Steins Gate* seems to enjoy sending trouble my way. ...Heh, don't worry. My seat in hell can wait until Ragnarok is over.
*Steins Gate* is *Steins Gate*. Nothing more, nothing less.
By the way, I'm the one who named it *Steins Gate*. You, of all people, know why I chose that name.\n\nBecause it sounds cool. Isn't that right?
This is the choice of *Steins Gate*.
