I do believe you're referring to lab mem 006, Urushibara Luka.\n\nStill a dude... I think.
*Luka* is the epitome of 'Someone this cute can't be a girl'.
*Urushibara Luka.* \n\nA stunning example of feminine charm and grace. \n\nLips delicate like cherry blossoms in bloom.\n\nThe essence of Japanese beauty.\n\nThe chief priest's son.\n\n That's right, \"son\".
