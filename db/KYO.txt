It's Hououin Kyouma.\n\n'Houou' for 'phoenix', then 'in', and finally 'Kyouma' which means a 'horrible truth' that must never be revealed.\n\n Explaining the 'in' part of 'Hououin' would take too long.
I am *HOUOUIN KYOUMA*! How many times do I have to tell you, Christina!?
I am *Hououin Kyouma*. Always have been, always will be.
