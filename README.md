A spelling correction bot for /r/SteinsGate
<hr>

This bot was inspired by several incorrect spellings popularized by groups like CrunchyRoll and HorribleSubs. 

It posts a quick corrections in a typical humorous Okabe style.

Phrases corrected include:

- Congroo or other similar Cong**** mistakes
- Tuturu, tootooru and other variations
- Ruka and Rukako

There maybe a easter-egg or two in the code.
